# 1 Background: From the end of 2019 to the beginning of 2020, because of CONVID-19, closure measures were adopted in various parts of the country to curb the deterioration of the epidemic. As a result, the vast majority of citizens have stayed at home for more than half a month, and this time is still prolonged. During this period, people mostly chose or were required to walk out and buy the supplies they need. This caused people's cars to park in the garage for a long time without starting. In recent days, the closures have been lifted in various places, and people have resumed work one after another. However, due to the above situation, various problems have arisen in everyone's main transportation vehicles. As a result, some car maintenance centers ushered in business, but some problems followed. Some conservation stores under the same brand are unable to cope with soaring demand for services, while others have no business. This is inefficient, and customer churn can occur. 
# 2 Propose; For a maintenance center under a certain brand, I will
develop a WEB project, whose goal is to manage service resources scientifically, effectively target customers, coordinate the work of the maintenance center, and share typical car problems. And in the design process, special services needed during special periods, such as sterilization in the car, starting a car with a lack of electricity, repairing tires on the door, etc.
